Project: FAVILER
File Status: Partially Declassified
Original Creation Date: November 1943

Executive Summary

Project FAVILER began as a secret research initiative during World War II to study the possibility of integrating functionally different human organs into a single, functional nervous system. The project's basic premise was to test whether neural signals could be rerouted so that a human organ would function outside its normal anatomical location.

The scientific impetus for the project came from the work of Polish-American anatomist Dr. Oko Daurins, who claimed in 1942 to have successfully conducted a preliminary experiment that, according to him, proved that neural consciousness could be redistributed within an unconventional bodily structure.

Scientific Background

According to Daurins's personal diaries, which were later seized, the researcher conducted an unauthorized experiment that included:

Attaching a human head to an amputated leg.

Reconnecting peripheral nerves using fine silver wires.

Stimulating neural activity by injecting high doses of amphetamine compounds. Dawrins recorded the following observations:

A reflex blink.

Slow muscle contractions in the foot.

Synchronized electrical responses between dissimilar tissues.

He wrote in his notebook:

"The brain isn't looking for the right body… it's looking for any body that can hear."

Dawrins believed the discovery could allow for the development of soldiers capable of continuing to function despite life-threatening injuries.

Project Establishment

After presenting the results to government agencies, a limited experimental program using prisoners of war was approved under the supervision of the Biomedical Research Unit.

Project Objectives:

To test the redistribution of neural control.

To study the feasibility of creating hybrid body systems.

To increase biological tolerance through chemical stimuli.

Experimental Methodology

The experiments included:

Integrating multiple limbs into a single nervous system.

Connecting anatomically incompatible nerves.

Using escalating doses of amphetamines to maintain neural activity.

An unexpected phenomenon was observed after the third week:

Some participants lost their need for sleep.

An abnormal increase in metabolic rate.

Expedited physical growth beyond known human proportions.

Behavioral Deviations

The experimental subjects began exhibiting unexplained characteristics:

Constant alertness without nervous breakdown.

Synchronized collective response despite isolation.

Repeated verbalization of a single word upon seeing Dr. Dawrins:

"faviler"

No meaning for the word has been found in any known language.

Incident F-9

On May 17, 1943, Dr. Dawrins left the laboratory to go to the branch storerooms to obtain additional solutions.

During his brief absence, the following were recorded:

The doors of the confinement were opened from the inside.

Several experimental subjects moved despite their physical disabilities.

The recordings were interrupted for six minutes.

When the recording resumed, the cameras showed:

A group attack on Dr. Dawrins.

His body being torn to pieces.

The subjects reassembling his head and legs using surgical instruments.

He was then injected with large quantities of amphetamines.

The Final Stage

Over the following days, rapid changes were observed in the resulting entity:

Progressive enlargement of one eye.

Disproportionate expansion of the skull.

Increased brain activity accompanied by constant screaming.

The last recorded audio report stated:

"He is conscious… fully… and seems to understand what he has become."

The medical team noted the emergence of clear signs of pain and conscious regret.

According to the last written note before the facility was closed, the entity's sole purpose became to be in

SUBJECT

Biological Integration Experiments Conducted Under Interior Department Authorization (1942–1943)

SUMMARY

Between March 1942 and June 1943, a classified biomedical initiative investigated neural adaptability following extreme anatomical restructuring. The program originated from proposals submitted by anatomist Dr. Oko Daworenz.

Primary hypothesis:

The human nervous system may sustain functional signaling independent of natural anatomical configuration.

OBSERVED RESULTS

Peripheral nerves accepted foreign integration at a 31% success rate.

Reflex responses persisted beyond expected biological viability.

Amphetamine stimulation delayed tissue death significantly.

Unexpected outcomes:

Persistent wakefulness exceeding 240 hours.

Accelerated tissue growth.

Emergence of synchronized behavioral responses among subjects.

Subjects repeatedly vocalized a phonetic construct:

<span class="redacted">“Faviler.”</span>

No linguistic origin identified.

INCIDENT SUMMARY

Containment failure occurred May 17, 1943.

Lead researcher deceased following coordinated subject aggression.

Post-incident observation suggests subjects attempted reconstructive procedures on researcher remains using learned surgical behavior.

Program terminated shortly thereafter.

Facility sealed.

FINAL NOTE (Analyst Comment)

“The experiment did not fail biologically. It failed psychologically.”

SUBJECT F-03

Pulse detected without coherent anatomy.

Eye movement independent from respiratory rhythm.

Subject attempts locomotion despite absence of skeletal alignment.

Staff instructed not to interpret sounds as speech.

They are patterns, not language.

DAY 19

Subjects no longer sleep.

When lights are turned off, movement increases.

When lights return, they stop simultaneously.

No command issued.

DAY 23

All subjects turned toward observation window at exactly 02:14.

No stimulus detected.

They spoke together:

Recording equipment malfunctioned immediately afterward.
